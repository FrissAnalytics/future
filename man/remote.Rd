\title{Create a remote future whose value will be resolved asynchroneously in a remote process}
\usage{
remote(expr, envir = parent.frame(), substitute = TRUE, globals = TRUE,
  persistent = TRUE, workers = NULL, gc = FALSE, earlySignal = FALSE,
  myip = NULL, run = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{An R \link[base]{expression}.}

\item{envir}{The \link{environment} in which the evaluation
is done and from which globals are obtained.}

\item{substitute}{If TRUE, argument \code{expr} is
\code{\link[base]{substitute}()}:ed, otherwise not.}

\item{globals}{If TRUE, global objects are validated at the point
in time when the future is created (always before it is resolved),
that is, they identified and located.  If some globals fail to be
located, an informative error is generated.}

\item{persistent}{If FALSE, the evaluation environment is cleared
from objects prior to the evaluation of the future.}

\item{workers}{A cluster object created by
\code{\link[parallel]{makeCluster}()}.}

\item{gc}{If TRUE, the garbage collector run (in the process that
evaluated the future) after the value of the future is collected.}

\item{earlySignal}{Specified whether conditions should be signaled as soon as possible or not.}

\item{myip}{The external IP address of this machine.
If NULL, then it is inferred using an online service (default).}

\item{run}{If TRUE, the future is also launched, otherwise nit.}

\item{\dots}{Not used.}
}
\value{
A \link{ClusterFuture}.
}
\description{
A remote future is a future that uses remote cluster evaluation,
which means that its \emph{value is computed and resolved
remotely in another process}.
}
\details{
Note that remote futures use \code{persistent=TRUE} by default.

## Use a remote machine
plan(remote, workers="remote.server.org")

## Evaluate expression remotely
